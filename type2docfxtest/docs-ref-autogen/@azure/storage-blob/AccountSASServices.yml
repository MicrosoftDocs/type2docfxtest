  ONLY AVAILABLE IN NODE.JS RUNTIME.

  This is a helper class to construct a string representing the services
  accessible by an AccountSAS. Setting a value

  to true means that any SAS which uses these permissions will grant access to
  that service. Once all the

  values are set, this should be serialized with toString and set as the
  services field on an

  <xref:@azure/storage-blob.AccountSASSignatureValues> object. It is possible to
  construct the services string without this class, but

  the order of the services is particular and this class guarantees correctness.
