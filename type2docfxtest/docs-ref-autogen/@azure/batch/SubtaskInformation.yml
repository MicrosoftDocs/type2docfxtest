      The exit code of the program specified on the subtask command line. This
      property is set only

      if the subtask is in the completed state. In general, the exit code for a
      process reflects the

      specific convention implemented by the application developer for that
      process. If you use the

      exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure that you know the
      exit code convention

      used by the application process. However, if the Batch service terminates
      the subtask (due to

      timeout, or user termination via the API) you may see an operating
      system-defined exit code.
