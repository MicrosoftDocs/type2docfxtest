      A prefix to be added to the unique identifier when a Pool is automatically

      service assigns each auto Pool a unique identifier on creation. To
      distinguish between Pools

      created for different purposes, you can specify this element to add a
      prefix to the ID that is

      assigned. The prefix can be up to 20 characters long.

      service does not delete

      the Pool automatically. It is up to the user to delete auto Pools created
      with this option.
