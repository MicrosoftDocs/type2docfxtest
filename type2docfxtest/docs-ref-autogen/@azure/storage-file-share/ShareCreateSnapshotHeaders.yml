      The ETag contains a value which represents the version of the share
      snapshot, in quotes. A share snapshot cannot be modified, so the ETag of a
      given share snapshot never changes. However, if new metadata was supplied
      with the Snapshot Share request then the ETag of the share snapshot
      differs from that of the base share. If no metadata was specified with the
      request, the ETag of the share snapshot is identical to that of the base
      share at the time the share snapshot was taken.
