summary: >-
  Keeps track of the listeners assigned to a particular incoming call because
  when we get an event from SDK, it doesn't

  tell us which incoming call it is for. If we keep track of this then we know
  which incoming call in the state that

  needs an update and also which property of that incoming call. Also we can use
  this when unregistering to a incoming

  call.
