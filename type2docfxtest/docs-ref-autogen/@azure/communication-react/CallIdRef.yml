summary: >-
  Internal object used to hold callId. This is so when we create the closure
  that includes this container we can update

  the container contents without needing to update the closure since the closure
  is referencing this object otherwise

  if the closure contains a primitive the updating of the primitive does not get
  picked up by the closure.
