    summary: >
      Indicates whether the message should be settled automatically based on the
      result from the

      user provided `processMessage` callback.

      - If an error is thrown from the `processMessage` callback the message
      will be abandoned
        using `receiver.abandonMessage()`. Doing so will make the message available again from the
        queue/subscription and the delivery count will be incremented.
      - If NO error is thrown from `processMessage` the message will be
      completed
        using `receiver.completeMessage()`. Doing so removes the message from the queue/subscription.

      This option is ignored if messages are received in the `receiveAndDelete`
      receive mode or if

      the message is already settled in the user provided message callback.


      - **Default**: `true`.
